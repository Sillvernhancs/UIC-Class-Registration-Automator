## **How to use the bot with Outlook:**

-  Make sure to have install outlook (for the people that works in the school and have to use outlook as their UIC mail)
-  Make sure that outlook is running before running the bot. 
    -  Note: (Use the minimize when close options to put Outlook away and still running)
    -  Always have to keep running in the background
-  Run 'run_outlook.bat' and type in your NetID and password
-  Leave it there. Once it ran, the moment you receive an open seat notification it will automatically grab that seat for you.

-  common ones are : 
   -  just a wait list
   -  time conflict
   -  not sure, if anything else goes wrong report to issues, ty.
