## **How to use the bot wit Gmail:**

-  Head to [Google App Password](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)
-   In "Select app" field, select Custome and name it whatever you want (recommend ReadEmail) and hit Generate
-   Copy the password that it gives you and keep it somewhere save, do not share that with anyone.
-   Download and unzip the bot, and run 'run_gmail.bat'
-   Type in NetID and password
-   Type in Gmail and past in the generated password from google app password
-   The bot will now wait until there's a notification for open seats and will start yoinking it.

## **How to use the bot with Outlook:**
-  Make sure to have installed python (the one from windows store is recommended)
-  Make sure to have install outlook (for the people that works in the school and have to use outlook as their UIC mail)
-  Make sure that outlook is running before running the bot. 
    -  Note: (Use the minimize when close options to put Outlook away and still running)
    -  Always have to keep running in the background
-  Run 'run_outlook.bat' and type in your NetID and password
-  Leave it there. Once it ran, the moment you receive an open seat notification it will automatically grab that seat for you.
## **If there was a message saying something went wrong with the CRN:**
-  common ones are : 
   -  just a wait list
   -  time conflict
   -  not sure, if anything else goes wrong report to issues, ty.
